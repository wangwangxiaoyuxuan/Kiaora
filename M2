# Pseudo M2: Markov Distinction
#
# 0. Allow user to input a drawing
# 1. Store/Generate a Markov Chain
    - what kind of information should the chain save?
    - if it saved coordinates, what would the initial
      probability matrix look like?
    - So, it needs to save multiple drawings to have probabilities
        - i.e., the first location is 30/70 to be at coord1/coord2,
          and the second location is 40/60 to be at coord1/coord2...
# 2. Draw in turtle based on the Markov Chain
