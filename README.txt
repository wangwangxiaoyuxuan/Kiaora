Kiaora - a Response to Mission 2: A Markov Distinction by James Wang
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kiaora is an imitative text illustrator. It takes in a text,
imitates it, then generates a visual representation of the imitation.

Python version 3.6 and higher.

Module Dependencies:
    - random
    - turtle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Setup:
    - Put all program files and to-be-imitated text files in a single
      directory.
    - Run String_Illustrator and follow the prompts carefully.

What happens in a run of Kiaora:
    1.You will be prompted to enter a desired Markov Chain length. It
      will be used to form the imitative text, with the chain length
      being the degree of likeliness to the sample text.
    2.You will then be asked to select how you will supply a sample
      text, either as a file or as input. Using a text file will
      allow imitation of e-books downloaded from Project Gutenberg.
      Using input allows imitation of your typing voice.
    3.Depending on your selection of file or input sampling, this is
      when you must give the file name or your string input.
    4.Lastly, you will be prompted to give a desired text length.
    5.The imitative text is printed, along with a list of all the
      word segments that are in it and a reinterpretation of these
      segments as drawing instructions.
    6.A turtle window the size of your moniter is opened and the
      illustration begins.

Personal meaningfulness:
  - The name "Kiaora" is derived from something I saw on some wall.
    The reason why this imitative text illustrator is called Kiaora
    is because this name is reminiscent of the chiaroscuro technique
    in art and singing, which is the technique of combining contrast-
    ful light and dark elements. The illustration this program makes
    is colorful and bright, but its origins cannot be clearly seen.
  - I'm also curious to how a language sounds to a person who doesn't
    speak it. Since I already speak English and any attempt at repre-
    senting it through alphabets will allow me to guess the pronounc-
    iation, I decided that a synesthetic approach might be helpful.

Challenge:
  - This is my first time implementing code originally written in a
    different language to Python.
  - Balancing effort between idea generating and idea implementing.

Creativity:
  - As of now, I cannot read the illustrations nor can I distinguish
    a stylistic difference between one text and another through them.
    However, maybe being exposed to this weaving of colors and
    shapes long enough will teach me a new sense, like a new language
    , such that I can see who is speaking behind the illustration.
